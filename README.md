# To-do or Task list APP
This is my first app - To-do list created with react native. 

Functionality:
1. Add your daily tasks
2. You can remove a task by tapping on it

Next improvement:
1. Allow user to move the tasks up and down to show the tasks' priority.


Icon:
I've put this icon image "target.png" in a new folder created as "assets" in the same path as other (.js) files.
