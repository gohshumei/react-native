# To-do or Task list APP
Yay! I finally created first app with react native - a todo list or task list.

This project is created along with a course I'm currently taking:
www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide.


Functionality:
1. Add your daily tasks
2. You can remove a task by tapping on it

Next improvement:
1. Allow user to move the tasks up and down to show the tasks' priority.


Others:
The app's icon is obtained from: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/target_538334?term=target&page=1&position=67&origin=search&related_id=538334
I've put this icon image "target.png" in a new folder created as "assets" in the same path as other (.js) files.
